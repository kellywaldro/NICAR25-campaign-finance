# NICAR25-campaign-finance

In this workshop, we'll go over the basics of campaign finance data. Then, we'll look at a sample dataset from San Francisco's November 2024 general election in `Nov-24-election.ipynb`. 

## Where to get the data 
This varies based on the jurisdiction and what kind of political races you are looking for: 

For federal campaign finance filings, the **Federal Election Commission (FEC)** publishes disclosures, and is the independent regulatory agency charged with administering and enforcing the federal campaign finance law. Here’s the data portal. 

For state and local campaign finance filings, which entity publishes disclosures varies. 
For instance, in California, the **Secretary of State** publishes state-level campaign finance data, and the **California Fair Political Practices Commission** is the regulatory agency that oversees campaign finance law. In San Francisco, the **Ethics Commission** enforces ethics and campaign finance laws and publishes records. 

## Considerations

### Disclosure requirements 

- What are donors and candidates required to disclose? Which form(s) need to be submitted?

### Deadlines 
- What are the reporting schedules and deadlines?

### Contribution limits 
- What is the maximum amount of money a donor can give to a candidate or campaign, if any? 

  Note: Is the committee receiving donations a candidate-controlled committee or an independent expenditure committee?

## Tips 

- Research the reporting requirements in the jurisdiction you are reporting on. Talk to political consultants. 
- If a contribution doesn’t make sense, reference the source material, i.e. the original filed form. 
- Use RSS feeds (if possible) to stay on top of new filings that are published.
